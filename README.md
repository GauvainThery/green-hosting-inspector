## 🚀 What is Green Hosting Inspector?

The Green Hosting Inspector is a Visual Studio Code extension that checks if URLs in your code are hosted on environmentally friendly hosting providers. It uses the Green Web Foundation's API to perform these checks.

## 🛠️ Features

- 🌐 **URL Analysis**: Automatically detects URLs in your code and checks if they are hosted on green hosting providers.
- 🎨 **Visual Feedback**: Highlights green-hosted URLs in green and non-green-hosted URLs in red directly in your code editor.
- 🔄 **Caching**: Results are cached for a week to improve performance.

## 📦 Installation

1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X` (`Cmd+Shift+X` on Mac).
3. Search for "Green Hosting Inspector" in the Extensions Marketplace.
4. Click "Install" to add the extension to your VS Code.

Alternatively, you can install it from the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/).

## 🧑‍💻 How to Use

1. Open a file in VS Code that contains URLs (e.g., `.js`, `.ts`, `.html`, etc.).
2. The extension will automatically detect URLs and check if they are hosted on green hosting providers.
3. Green-hosted URLs will be highlighted in green, while non-green-hosted URLs will be highlighted in red.
